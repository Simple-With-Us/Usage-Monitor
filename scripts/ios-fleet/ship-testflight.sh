# Options:
#   --repo-root PATH   Repo root (default: cwd)
#   --build N          Force CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION (exact; default: the repo
#                      commit count, raised above the App Store Connect floor)
#   --version X.Y.Z    Force MARKETING_VERSION (exact; default: the next patch
#                      on the app's train)
#   --export-only      Build IPA only; do not upload
#   --upload-only IPA  Skip archive; upload an existing IPA via ASC API key
#   --dry-run          Print plan and exit
#   --skip-xcodegen    Do not regenerate .xcodeproj
#   --allow-dirty      Allow shipping from a dirty git worktree
#   --force-ship       Bypass min-interval + same-HEAD skip (emergency / owner)
#   --sync-project-version  Write the resolved version into project.pbxproj
#   --allow-unverified-seq  Ship even if App Store Connect cannot be consulted
#                           (dangerous: the marketing version and the build
#                           number are then planned from unverified state)
#
# Version numbering (owner directive 2026-10-24, AFC-517; replaces the
# 1.0.<commit_count> scheme of 2026-10-18):
#   MARKETING_VERSION       = <prefix>.<P+1>
#       <prefix> is the train from marketingVersionDefault (1.0).  P is the
#       highest patch already used on that train in App Store Connect, counting
#       BOTH the App Store versions (appStoreVersions.versionString) AND the
#       TestFlight trains (preReleaseVersions.version) for the app's platform.
#       A TestFlight train that holds a build named after its own patch (the
#       "1.0.2358 (2358)" drift trains) is IGNORED, so those uploads no longer
#       push the version forward.  App Store versions are never ignored.
#   CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION = the repo commit count (git rev-list --count
#       HEAD), raised when needed so that it is strictly greater than every
#       build already in the TARGET marketing train (old 12-digit UTC stamps
#       included:  Apple requires build numbers to grow inside one train) and
#       than the app's highest plain-integer build below 1000000000 on that
#       platform.  On macOS EVERY build counts, because macOS build numbers
#       have to grow across all trains.
#   The two numbers are INDEPENDENT:  the build number never names the
#       marketing version, and the marketing version never names the build.  The
#       only coupling is a safety rule:  a ship must never look like "1.0.N (N)",
#       so a build that happens to equal the patch number moves one up.
#   --version X.Y.Z is an exact marketing override and --build N an exact build
#       override.  With --version only the build is still automatic (the commit
#       count, floored against that train);  with --build only the marketing
#       version is still the automatic next patch.
#   App Store Connect renders "<marketing> (<build>)", e.g. "1.0.237 (2360)".
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT IS HOLDING BACK AUTOMATIC SHIPPING: THE MIN-INTERVAL RATE LIMIT
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Applies to uploads only (--export-only and --dry-run are free):
#   DEFAULT MINIMUM INTERVAL BETWEEN SUCCESSFUL TESTFLIGHT SHIPS, PER APP:
#       DEFAULT_MIN_INTERVAL_SEC=3600  (3600 seconds = 1 hour)
#   That constant is defined a few dozen lines below and is the main reason a
#   merge to main does not become a TestFlight build. .github/workflows/
#   ios-ship.yml fires on every push to main touching clients/ios/**, and this
#   gate turns most of those runs into a no-op skip (exit 0).
#   Override for one run:  IOS_TF_MIN_INTERVAL_SEC=7200 (2h)  or  --force-ship
#   Change the default:    edit DEFAULT_MIN_INTERVAL_SEC below (owner's call).
#
#   Also skips when git HEAD matches the last successful ship (no new commits).
#   Skip exits 0 ("nothing to do") so agent loops stay quiet, and a skipped run
#   does NOT resolve or consume a version (see the ship-gate ordering note
#   at the call site).
#   State: ~/.cache/ios-fleet/last-ship-<app>.txt  (unix_ts + space + git_sha)
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# POST-UPLOAD: ensure-tf-ready AND TESTFLIGHT RELEASE NOTES (2026-08-13)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ensure_tf_ready now passes BUILD_NUM (CFBundleVersion) to asc-api.mjs, which
# polls App Store Connect until THAT EXACT BUILD appears and only then declares
# export compliance on it. Before this it took "the newest build", which for the
# first minutes after an upload is the PREVIOUS ship -- so compliance was
# declared on the wrong build and the "testers can install this" line described
# a build it had never looked at.
#   IOS_TF_READY_TIMEOUT_SEC   discovery + readiness budget (default 900s)
#   exit 4 from asc-api.mjs    uploaded build never surfaced; warn, do NOT fail
#                              (record_successful_ship must still run or the rate
#                              gate never advances)
#
# It also renders the mandatory AGENT-SYNC "What to Test" release note from the
# commit range since the last successful ship. THIS IS OPT-IN, because it writes
# copy every TestFlight tester reads:
#   IOS_TF_RELEASE_NOTES=1     publish to App Store Connect
#   IOS_TF_RELEASE_NOTES=0     off entirely
#   unset (DEFAULT)            dry render into the ship log; nothing is written
#   IOS_TF_RELEASE_TITLE=...   override the "<App> Update" title
# CI needs `fetch-depth: 0` on actions/checkout or the runner workspace holds a
# single commit and the range is uncomputable (verified 2026-08-13 on all three
# fleet runners).
#
# Secrets (never printed):
#   Infisical Fleet-OPS via `fleet-secrets get` (AFC-359; no handoff file is read):
#     ASC_KEY_ID, ASC_ISSUER_ID, ASC_KEY_P8   folder /asc  (ASC_KEY_P8 is the .p8 text;
#                                 written to a 0600 temp dir for the life of the ship,

#   - it names the EXACT commit a build came from, so a TestFlight or Sparkle
#     build can be traced to source without a second lookup
#   - it is monotonic by construction, so it can never regress
#   - it is raised above the App Store Connect floor when it has to be (a
#     shallow checkout understates the count, and the retired UTC stamps are
#     still higher than a fresh commit count)
#
# The two numbers are independent.  The build number is NEVER derived from
# the marketing version, and the marketing version is never derived from the
# build number:  that is what stopped App Store Connect from showing
# "1.0.2358 (2358)".
#
# App Store Connect is the only record that shipping advances, so it is the
# only record that can answer "which patches does this train hold?" and
# "which build numbers are taken?".  The local build-seq counter
# (~/.cache/ios-fleet/build-seq-<app>.txt) and the MARKETING_VERSION in
# project.pbxproj are NOT sources any more:  the counter is never written,
# and the project file is only read to print the agreement NOTICE.

# Highest N in MARKETING_VERSION = <prefix>.N across the project's build
# configurations. 0 when the file is unreadable or holds no on-train value.
#
# NOT A SEQUENCING INPUT.  project.pbxproj does not feed the marketing

# rate-limited attempt burned a version that never shipped (observed live
# 2026-08-12: skipped at 4392s of a 9000s interval, sequence still went 5 -> 6).
#
# Everything the gate needs is already resolved above: APP_KEY, REPO_ROOT (for
# HEAD), EXPORT_ONLY, FORCE_SHIP, STATE_DIR. Nothing between here and the old
# call site set up anything it reads, so moving it earlier drops no step. What
# it now runs BEFORE is: PBXPROJ resolution, the App Store Connect queries
# (the marketing patch and the build floor), the project-version agreement
# check, --sync-project-version, load_secrets, and the output dirs.  No
# number is consumed from a local cache any more:  App Store Connect is the
# only record that shipping advances.
# The dirty-worktree check stays ahead of the gate so a dirty tree still fails
# loudly rather than being masked by a quiet rate-limit skip.
#
# --force-ship and --export-only still bypass the gate exactly as before, and
# --dry-run still reports the gate outcome alongside the version plan (it peeks
# at the version without shipping it, so evaluating early changes nothing for
# it beyond ordering the log lines).
