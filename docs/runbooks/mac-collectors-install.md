# Mac Collector Install (installed copy, not ~/Code)

Owner rule: `~/Code/<App>` is the human integration tree and a daemon resets it.
A LaunchAgent that executes `~/Code/Usage-Monitor/scripts/...` runs whatever
that tree happens to hold, and breaks when the tree moves.  The Mac collector
LaunchAgents therefore run from an installed copy:

```
~/apps/usage-monitor-collectors/        (override: UM_COLLECTORS_HOME)
  scripts/                              collector entry points + scripts/lib
  node_modules/zod                      only third-party import the collectors have
  VERSION                               git sha, install time, source checkout
```

## Install or refresh

From any Usage-Monitor lane or checkout that holds the code you want live:

```bash
scripts/install-collectors.sh            # copy files, smoke-check every entry point
scripts/install-collectors.sh --plists   # also repoint + reload the LaunchAgents
```

`--plists` touches only the `com.jays.*collector` LaunchAgents that still
reference a `Usage-Monitor/scripts/` path, plus the Antigravity CLI `statusLine`
hook in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`.  The script refuses a
destination under `~/Code`.  Re-run it after merging collector changes; the
copy does not update itself.

Check what is live with `cat ~/apps/usage-monitor-collectors/VERSION`.

## Why a collector can sit at HTTP 409 for weeks (UM-1469)

Every v2 event is stamped with `metadata._producerInstanceId`, the sending
host's name.  When macOS renamed this Mac (`jays.services` to
`Mac.Jays.Services`, Sep 17 2026), every collector replay of an older event
differed from its stored row only in that label, ingest answered
`409 idempotency_conflict` for the whole batch, and because collectors advance
their checkpoint only after a clean ack, the same batch was re-sent every 15
minutes until Oct 15.

Fixes now in place:

* Ingest ignores the host label (and a `machine` field that merely echoes it)
  when deciding whether a replay is the same event.  Real content differences
  still collide.
* Collectors isolate a conflicting event by halving the batch, log its
  `eventId`, skip it and let the rest land, so one bad event can no longer
  freeze a stream.  The 409 body is now part of the thrown error.
* Maintenance sends one Pushover per UTC day when a watched
  (`sourceApp`, `metricType`) stream goes quiet (`src/lib/producer-staleness.ts`;
  allowances live in `PRODUCER_STREAM_RULES`; disable with
  `USAGE_PRODUCER_STALENESS_DISABLED=1`).

## Known non-collector gaps

* `claude-code` quota from this Mac: the subscription-quota collector no longer
  reads the Keychain (PR #1592).  It needs `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_CREDENTIALS_JSON`
  injected by a launchd wrapper; see
  `scripts/claude-code-oauth-credentials-from-keychain.sh`.  The Keychain item
  needs a one-time "Always Allow" grant from the owner.
* `agent-bar` quota: retired.  The app was renamed CodeCaps and reports as
  `codecaps` since Sep 21 2026.
* `com.jays.mac-server-watchdog` still runs from the checkout; it is a host
  heartbeat, not a collector, and is not covered by the installer.
